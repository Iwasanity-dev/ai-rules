# AI-Assisted Development Guide

> AI can only be as smart as its user.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of practical lessons learned from building projects with AI assistance. These insights come from real-world experience using tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and Claude to develop software projects.

While many of these lessons might seem like fundamental programming principles (and they are!), their importance is magnified when working with AI. Good practices like proper project structure, breaking down problems, and writing tests become even more critical when collaborating with AI tools. This guide explains these principles from an AI-assisted development perspective, showing how they specifically impact and improve your interaction with AI coding assistants.

## Quick Start
